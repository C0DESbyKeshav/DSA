// Flowcharts => diagram representation of code

/*
Steps to follow whenever you have to code on a problem statement:
1. Understand the problem statement
2. All the given values must be available
3. The actual approach to solve that problem
4. Code
5. Error / Debug the code
6. Other solutions / approach for that same problem statement

Oval -> Terminal (Start / End)
Parallelogram -> Input / Output
Rectangle -> Process
Diamond -> Condition
Arrow -> Flow of Diagram
*/

/*
Pseudo Code:
Read a,b
ans = a + b
Print ans
*/

// After this some very easy flowcharts and algorithms; try it by yourself.

/*
Loop: Once all the instructions are given, we can repeat the same process as many times as we want, this is called looping.
