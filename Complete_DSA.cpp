// INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING

Neeche likhe gaye paragraph ek assumption hai aur uska vaastik jeevan se koi sambandh nhi hai: 
Aaj se maanlo 10000 saal pahile, aadimaanav log ka bass itna hi kaam rehta tha ki khaao aur sou jaao.
Woh log yeh hi do task ko repeat karte rehte the.
Ab kuch samay baad woh log apna kaam nikaalne ke liye, cow, goat, dog, horse jaise animals paalne lag gaye.
Ab uss time pe toh number system exists bhi nhi karta tha.
Toh woh log ke paas yeh pata lagane ka method hi nhi tha ki total kitne goats hai aur shaam tak saare waapis aagaye ki nhi.
Phir woh log ne 1 jugaad chaalu kiya ki 1 goat aaya toh 1 stone apne paas rakh liya toh woh log toh pata chal jaata tha ki mere poore 5 ya 10 goats waapis aa gaye.
Ab jaise hi uske paas 500 goats aa gayi toh ab woh 500 stones to pocket mein leke nahi ghoom sakta hai har jagah.
Here, the Number System cam to be in need.

Most of the people don't know that the number system is invented by the Indians.
Not just ZERO (by Aryabhatta) but also the entire number system is invented by the Indians.
Decimal Number System -> Base 10 system: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
Before that Egyptians used to do the counting by Base 60 system which was completely different. (There's no need to get into the details of history of Egyptians counting system)
But the decimal number system was the one that became popular because humans are / were very much familiar with 10 numbers.

How people used to add numbers back then:
Decimal Number System : {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
ex: 8 + 5 = 13
1. First keep the pointer on 7
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
                 *
2. Move towards right counting from 1 to 5 after 8 in mind
3. Keep the pointer on number at which the counting ended up
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
       *
4. Now write the final answer
8 + 5 = 1 3  --- (from step 3)
        ^ #
^ (tens place) pe 1 aayega since counting karte karte 1 baar bracket ke bahar jaake bracket ko repeat karna pada
# (units place) pe 3 aayega since counting karne ke baad pointer 3 pe aakar ruka

Now, assume a person has to do profit and loss calculation of 5 sales in a register.
All good untill that number changes to 500 calculations.
Even if we just have to carry out add and subtract operations, the probability of doing mistake is very high in 500 entries.
This was a major problem in the society.
To resolve this, our friend COMPUTER came in.
At that time, the original meaning of computer was: To Calculate
At that time, the size of a mechanical computer was same as a room we live in.
Physical labor was needed to run the computer.
Accuracy was provided but it was not even that fast and to make the computer hit in entire world for the use of even a common man, the reduce in size of that hardware box (computer) had to be taken care of.

Transistor:
Invention of this thing changed the entire digital world.
Since transistor is a bulb, either it will be on or off (i.e 1 or 0) i.e binary number.
Binary number consits of ony two unit digits --> 0 and 1, and rest are combinations of these two digits.
It is a base 2 number system.
